## Landsat Reflectance Data: On the Fly and at Your Fingertips
### Challenge
Develop a web-based application that supports the comparison of ground-based observations with Landsat data by allowing users to define a target location, receive notifications when Landsat is to pass over that location, and then access and display the corresponding Landsat SR data.
